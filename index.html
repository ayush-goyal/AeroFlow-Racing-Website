In this vastly competitive league, teams of 3-6 develop cars utilizing CAD and other related tools. However, the complexity of what we do reaches beyond mere engineering and into fields of business/marketing, graphic design, and possibly most importantly if considering real-world application, team management and cooperation. Then, each of these skill sets developed throughout the team process is put to the test at regional, national, and world level competitions. As a result, F1 in Schools has created a system which effectively develops and enhances students’ learning experience through their interests as well as by teaching necessary real-world situations/applications.</p><footer class="major"><ul class="actions"><li><a href="http://www.f1inschools.com" class="button big" target="_blank">Learn More</a></li></ul></footer></section><!-- Past Results --><section id="results" class="main special"><header class="major"><h2>Past Results</h2></header><p>The AeroFlow Racing team just returned from a very successful 2017 F1 in Schools National Finals in Austin, Texas.
